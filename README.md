# 🌐 Alisha's Portfolio
This repository will grow into my personal portfolio website, where I will showcase my projects, reflect on my learning journey, and express my creative brand, **CodeInTheHook**.

## ✨ Purpose
- Create a clean, welcoming space to highlight my work
- Share my growth as I learn Python, Git, and web development
- Build a foundation for future projects and professional opportunities

## 🛠️ Planned Tech Stack
- Python (my main learning language right now)
- HTML & CSS (next on my learning path)
- JavaScript (later on, as I grow my web skills)
- Git & GitHub for version control

## :rocket: Future Plans
- Add project cards with descriptions and links
