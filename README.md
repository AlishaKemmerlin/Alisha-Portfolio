#  🧶 Alisha's Portfolio ー CodeInTheHook
This repository will grow into my personal portfolio website — a space to showcase my projects, reflect on my learning journey, and express my creative brand, **CodeInTheHook**.

---

## 🧵 Purpose
- Create a clean, welcoming space to highlight my work
- Share my growth as I learn Python, Git, and web development
- Build a foundation for future projects and professional opportunities

---

## ✂️ Planned Tech Stack
- Python (my main learning language right now)
- HTML & CSS (next on my learning path)
- JavaScript (later on, as I grow my web skills)
- Git & GitHub (for version control and collaboration)

## 📍 Current Status
Early development — planning structure, layout and content.

## 🌱 Future Plans
- Add project cards with descriptions and links
- Include my blog and GitHub activity
- Add a section for crochet + code crossover projects
- Create a minimalist, accessible design that reflects my style
