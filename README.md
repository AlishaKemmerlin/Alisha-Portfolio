# 👋 Hi, I'm Alisha Kemmerlin

I'm a beginner coder from South Carolina, blending creativity and tech—crochet hooks in one hand, keyboard in the other. I’m a student at Maestro College, learning Python and web design, while also building warm, welcoming online spaces for my church and community.

## 💼 What I Bring
- Customer service & admin support (retail, healthcare, food service)
- Microsoft Office, POS systems, and remote communication tools
- WordPress + Elementor site building
- SEO optimization and internal linking
- 50 WPM typing and strong organizational skills

## 🧵 Projects
- **Contacts Demo** – A simple app to store and display contact info
- **Church Website** – Designed a warm, welcoming gallery using WordPress and Elementor
- More coming soon as I learn and grow!

## 🎯 Goals
- Land a remote role in customer service, data entry, or admin support
- Build more coding projects (maybe a crochet pattern generator someday!)
- Keep learning Python, JavaScript, and web development
